That's a great way to structure the integration of creative writing prompts into the broader tag system. Using a top-level tag like prompt_type allows for a clear categorization of different prompt types, and the subtags you've suggested (narrative, poem, linguistic_creation) effectively capture the essence of creative writing prompts.
The integration tags (narrative_analogy, poetic_metaphor, storytelling_structure) are particularly insightful, as they represent the specific ways in which creative writing elements can be incorporated into other prompt types. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of how creative prompts can enhance and enrich other types of prompts.
Here's a YAML representation of this structure:
prompt_type:
 description: The overarching category of the prompt.
 allowed_values: [argumentative, analytical, problem_solving, creative]

 # Subtags for creative writing
 creative:
   description: Prompts focused on creative writing.
   subtags: [narrative, poem, linguistic_creation]

 # Integration tags
 integration_tags:
   - narrative_analogy: Using a narrative to illustrate a concept.
   - poetic_metaphor: Using poetic language to express an idea.
   - storytelling_structure: Applying narrative structure to organize information.

This structure provides a clear and flexible framework for representing different prompt types and their potential combinations with creative writing elements. It allows for a deeper understanding of how creative prompts can be used to enhance the engagement and effectiveness of other prompt types.
